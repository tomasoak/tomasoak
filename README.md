<h2>About me</h2>
  <p> Data Analytics Engineer with over 8 years of professional experience, passionate about transforming data into actionable insights and empowering decision-making. I specialize in building efficient data models and products to enhance business performance.

My multidisciplinary experience has honed my skills in team integration, project management, stakeholder alignment, developing business KPIs, and data-driven decision-making.

With my passion for using data for more immediate decision-making, I worked as a Senior BI Developer for one of the worldâ€™s most well-known non-profit charities. There, besides strengthening campaignâ€™s gains with data and technology, I fostered better C-Level and senior decision-making through dozens of marketing and finance dashboards and dbt models for their offices in the US, Netherlands, and Brazil.

As a Software Engineer, I have experience in building containerized and cloud infrastructure for back-end solutions, such as scalable APIs, and modeling and deploying OLTP databases.

I began my career and spent over 7 years working in high-profile non-profit organizations focused on improving sustainability in global agricultural supply chains through international projects in Latin America, the US, and Europe. Specifically, using Geospatial Data Analytics and Software Engineering, I contributed to key data products that improved deforestation-free commodity trade and thousands of indigenous communities lives in the Amazon Region. Besides, I have collaborated with organizations such as NASA and Chalmers University of Technology. Moreover, I co-author insightful research in prestigious scientific journals such as Nature Sustainability and Land Use Policy.

Proficient in Python, SQL, dbt, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, AWS, GCP, Tableau, Looker Studio, Git, Docker, and Terraform, I hold some technical certifications:
<br>

â€¢ AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
<br>
â€¢ dbt Fundamentals
<br>
â€¢ Tableau Desktop Specialist
